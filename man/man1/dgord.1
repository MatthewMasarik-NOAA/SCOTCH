.SH NAME
\fBdgord \fP- compute sparse matrix orderings in parallel
\fB
.SH SYNOPSIS

.fam C
\fBdgord\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIgfile\fP] [\fIofile\fP] [\fIlfile\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBdgord\fP program computes, in a parallel way, an ordering of a
source graph representing the pattern of some symmetric sparse
matrix.
.PP
Source graph file \fIgfile\fP is either a centralized graph file, or a set
of files representing fragments of a distributed graph. The resulting
ordering is stored in file \fIofile\fP. Eventual logging information (such
as the one produced by option \fB-v\fP) is sent to file \fIlfile\fP. When file
names are not specified, data is read from standard input and
written to standard output. Standard streams can also be explicitely
represented by a dash '-'.
.PP
When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, \fBdgord\fP
can directly handle compressed graphs, both as input and output. A
stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.grf.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma', on
input only).
.PP
\fBdgord\fP bases on implementations of the MPI interface to spread work
across the processing elements. It is therefore not likely to be run
directly, but instead through some launcher command such as \fBmpirun\fP.

.SH EXAMPLE
Run \fBdgord\fP on 5 processing elements to reorder matrix graph brol.grf
and save the resulting ordering to file brol.ord.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
      $ mpirun -np 5 dgord brol.grf brol.ord

.fam T
.fi
Run \fBdgord\fP on 5 processing elements to reorder the distributed matrix
stored on graph fragment files brol5-0.grf to brol5-4.grf, and save
the resulting ordering to file brol.ord (see \fBdgscat\fP(1) for an
explanation of the '%p' and '%r' sequences in names of distributed
graph fragments).
