Scotch 4.0 installation instructions
====================================


1) Mandatory tools
------------------

In order for you to compile Scotch, you must have GNU Make,
Lex and Yacc installed on your system. There is a possibility
to install Scotch without having Lex or Yacc, but it may require
the tuning of sample Flex and Bison (i.e., the GNU equivalents
of Lex and Yacc) outputs created on a Linux system, which may
need some tricky work to compile on other systems, because
of different C library implementations.

To check if GNU Make is installed and is found first, please
type :

%prompt% make --version

It should read:
% GNU Make x.xx
% Copyright (C) 20xx  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
etc, etc.

Alternatively, if GNU Make is installed but its directory does
not appear first in the PATH variable that is searched for
executables, you can try to locate it using the which command :

%prompt% which make

If several occurences of make are found, one might be GNU Make,
so try to figure out which of them.

To see if lex and yacc are present, type
%prompt% which lex
%prompt% which yacc    (or "bison", the GNU flavor of yacc)

If some of these are missing, please :
- check your path variable (just in case they are located in
  some unusual place, such as /usr/local/bin, /opt/bin,
  /opt/local/bin/, /opt/gnu/bin, etc). Tools such as "which",
  "locate" or "find" may help you find them;
- ask your system administrator (highly recommended);
- install a copy of GNU Make of your own (less recommended,
  please ask your system engineer first). GNU Make is available
  from the FSF website, at :
  http://www.gnu.org/software/make/ and
  http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make/
  A GNU version of lex and yacc is also available from the
  very same FSF website, at :
  http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/
  http://ftp.gnu.org/non-gnu/flex/
  http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/
  http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bison/ ;
- use the "last resort" files placed in a directory judiciously
  called "last_resort", located in subdirectory "src/libscotch".
  These files are :
  . parser_ll.c
  . parser_ly.h
  . parser_yy.c
  They should be copied in the directory where object files are
  created, and "touch"ed so that their modification date is more
  recent than the ones of the corresponding "parser_ll.l" and
  "parser_yy.y" files. Then cross your fingers and hope it
  compiles properly on your system...
  The Makefile of the libScotch library has been designed so as
  to copy the last_resort/* files automatically when the lex or
  yacc tools are not found.


2) Configuration
----------------

Go to the "src/" directory.

Look in the "Make.inc/" subdirectory for a configuration
file which matches your system configuration. If there
is none, build a proper one in the "Make.inc/" subdirectory.

Create a symbolic link from the configuration file to the
current "src/" working directory, renaming it as "Makefile.inc":

%prompt% ln -s Make.inc/Makefile.inc.xxxx_xxx_xxx Makefile.inc

If symbolic links are not available on your system, make a
plain copy of the file to a file named "Makefile.inc" in the
current "src/" working directory:

%prompt% cp Make.inc/Makefile.inc.xxxx_xxx_xxx Makefile.inc


Then, compile the Scotch distribution by simply typing "make"
in the current "src/" working directory.

If no error occurs, all of the relevant header, library and
executable files will be created and copied to the "../bin/"
directory, relatively to your current "src/" working
directory.


3) Documentation and use
------------------------

The Scotch user's manual is available in the "doc/" directory.
It describes how to use the libscotch library as well as the
standalone programs of the Scotch distribution.
